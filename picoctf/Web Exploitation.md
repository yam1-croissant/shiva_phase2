# Web Gauntlet
## Flag: picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
In this CTF, we need to bypass the given filters like or, or and like = --... etc using SQL injection

## Steps - 

1st filter is [OR], i couldnt use " OR 1=1" so my input was, and the reason it worked is:

```
admin' -- 
```
As username='_____ ,is how the code is written, when i enter admin' , the string is now closed. ( username = 'admin')

By adding -- at the end, it makes anything after -- is ignored by the database

2nd filter is [or and like = --], so now we cant use --, my input was:
```
admin'/*
```
just like anything after  /* is treated as a comment and ignored by the database

3rd filter is [or and = like >< --], for this i used the same input as previous. 

4th Filter is [or and = like -- admin] , we cant use 'admin' here.

I used string concatenation 
```
ad'||'min'/*
```

5th Filter is [or and = like > < -- union admin] , here union is filtered, so in the previous round if i had used ..... but as i used string concatenation i can use it again. 

```
ad'||'min'/*
```

# SSTI1
## Flag:
SSTI stands for Server Side Template Injection, this gives a hint about what the CTF is going to be about.

## Steps - 

First we need to find out what kind of language is the template built on, it can be php or python or java etc. 
To find out we need to run the {{config}}

We get this

This is python (FLASK) so we can proceed with the attack. 

```
{{ self.__init__.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('id').read() }}
```

self.__init__.__globals__ accesses the global namespace of the template object.

__builtins__  loads pythonâ€™s built-in functions.

__import__('os') imports the os module, which lets us interact with the os

.popen('id').read() ask the operating system to run a command and capture what it prints

This command when run we get

This tells us that we can indeed access the backend, so if we change id to ls we get

we see the flag, and we can cat it.
